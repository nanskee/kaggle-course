# Question 2

# You are thinking about buying a home and want to get an idea of how much you will spend, based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. You are trying to decide between four different options:

# Option 1: house with two bedrooms and three bathrooms
# Option 2: house with three bedrooms and two bathrooms
# Option 3: house with three bedrooms and three bathrooms
# Option 4: house with three bedrooms and four bathrooms
# Use the get_expected_cost() function you defined in question 1 to set option_1, option_2, option_3, and option_4 to the expected cost of each option.

option_one = 80000 + (30000 * 2) + (10000 * 3)
option_two = 80000 + (30000 * 3) + (10000 * 2)
option_three = 80000 + (30000 * 3) + (10000 * 3)
option_four = 80000 + (30000 * 3) + (10000 * 4)
